A database is usually controlled by a database management system (DBMS). Together, the data and the DBMS, along with the applications that are associated with them, are referred to as a database system, often shortened to just database.</b></p></center>

    <h1>What is Structured Query Language (SQL)?</h1>
    <p>SQL is a programming language used by nearly all relational databases to query, manipulate, and define data, and to provide access control. SQL was first developed at IBM in the 1970s with Oracle as a major contributor, which led to implementation of the SQL ANSI standard, SQL has spurred many extensions from companies such as IBM, Oracle, and Microsoft. Although SQL is still widely used today, new programming languages are beginning to appear.</p>
    <h2>SQL Basic Commands</h2>
    <p>We have a list of standard SQL commands to interact with relational databases, These commands are CREATE, SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, DROP and TRUNCATE and can be classified into the following groups based on their nature</p>

    <h2>Data Definition Language (DDL)</h2>
    <p>A Data Definition Language (DDL) is a computer language which is used to create and modify the structure of database objects which include tables, views, schemas, and indexes etc.</p>
    <center>
        <table border="2px">
            <tr><th>Command</th><th>Description</th></tr>
            <tr><td>CREATE</td><td>Creates a new table, a view of a table, or other object in the database.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>ALTER</td><td>Modifies an existing database object, such as a table.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>DROP</td><td>Deletes an entire table, a view of a table or other objects in the database.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>TRUNCATE</td><td>Truncates the entire table in a go.</td></tr>
        </table>
    </center>
    <h2>Data Manipulation Language (DML)</h2>
    <p>A Data Manipulation Language (DML) is a computer programming language which is used for adding, deleting, and modifying data in a database.</p>
    <center>
        <table border="2px">
            <tr><th>Command</th><th>Description</th></tr>
            <tr><td>INSERT</td><td>Creates a record.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>UPDATE</td><td>Modifies records.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>DELETE</td><td>Deletes records.</td></tr>
        </table>
    </center>

    <h2>Data Control Language (DCL)</h2>
    <p>Data Control Language (DCL) is a computer programming language which is used to control access to data stored in a database.</p>
    <center>
        <table border="2px">
            <tr><th>Command</th><th>Description</th></tr>
            <tr><td>GRANT</td><td>Gives a privilege to user</td></tr>
            <tr><td>REVOKE</td><td>Takes back privileges granted from user.</td></tr>
        </table>
    </center>

    <h2>Transaction control language (TCL)</h2>
    <p>A single unit of work in a database is formed after the consecutive execution of commands is known as a transaction.There are certain commands present in SQL known as TCL commands that help the user manage the transactions that take place in a database.</p>
    <center>
        <table border="2px">
            <tr><th>Command</th><th>Description</th></tr>
            <tr><td>COMMIT</td><td>COMMIT command in SQL is used to save all the transaction-related changes permanently to the disk.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>ROLLBACK</td><td>ROLLBACK command to the savepoint INS, which we have created before executing the DELETE query.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>SAVEPOINT</td><td>save all the insert related queries with the savepoint named INS. To save all the insert related queries in one savepoint, we have to execute the SAVEPOINT query followed by the savepoint name after finishing the insert command execution.</td></tr>
        </table>
    </center>

    <h2>Data Query Language (DQL)</h2>
    <p>select the attribute based on the condition described by WHERE clause.</p>
    <center>
        <table border="2px">
            <tr><th>Command</th><th>Description</th></tr>
            <tr><td>SELECT</td><td>select the attribute based on the condition described by WHERE clause.</td></tr>
        </table>
