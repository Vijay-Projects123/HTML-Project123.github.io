    <h1>What are Front End Technologies?</h1>
    <p>You'll use three main technologies in front-end development.</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong><a href="#html"><abbr title="Know More About HTML">HTML </abbr></a>
        <p>Pat describes HTML as the skeleton of a webpage. It's used to structure a webpages content, and it also tells the web browser how to display it.</p></strong></li>
        
        
        <li><strong><a href="#css"><abbr title="Know More About css">CSS</abbr></a>
        <p>The “skin and clothes of the webpage” according to Pat, CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) gives browsers more specific information on displaying content, like the size and color of text.</p></strong></li>
            
        <li><strong><a href="#js"><abbr title="Know More About JavaScript">JAVA SCRIPT</abbr></a>
        <p>There's more to websites than just text. JavaScript allows you to create more complex elements like interactive maps and animated graphics. It’s executed both in the browser and the server, which makes it versatile.</p></strong></li>
    </ul>

    <p>It's a fundamental part of every web developer's toolkit. HTML provides the content that gives web pages structure, by using elements and tags, you can add text, images, videos, forms, and more. Learning HTML basics is an important first step in your web development journey and an essential skill for front- and back-end developers.</p>

    <h2>Why HTML is used?</h2>
    <p>HTML is used to create the structure of web pages and website that are displayed on the Internet. HTML basically contains Tags and Attributes that are used to design the web pages. Also, we can link multiple pages using Hyperlinks.</p>
    <h2>HTML Basic Structure of Web Page</h2>
    <p>The basic structure of an HTML page is laid out below. It contains the essential building-block elements (i.e. doctype declaration, HTML, head, title, and body elements) upon which all web pages are created.</p>

    <h3>HTML Basic Tags</h3>
    
    <table border="3px">
        <tr><th>Tag</th><th>describes</th></tr>
        <tr><td>DOCTYPE! html</td><td>A doctype or document type declaration is an instruction that tells the web browser about the markup language in which the current page is written. It is not an element or tag. The doctype declaration is not case-sensitive.</td></tr>
        <tr><td>html</td><td> This tag is used to define the root element of HTML document. This tag tells the browser that it is an HTML document. It is the second outer container element that contains all other elements within it.</td></tr>
        <tr><td>head</td><td>This tag is used to define the head portion of the HTML document that contains information related to the document. Elements within the head tag are not visible on the front-end of a webpage.</td></tr>
        <tr><td>body</td><td>The body tag is used to enclose all the visible content of a webpage. In other words, the body content is what the browser will show on the front end.</td></tr>

    <p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to styles web pages. Cascading Style Sheets are fondly referred to as CSS. The reason for using this is to simplify the process of making web pages presentable. It allows you to apply styles on web pages. More importantly, it enables you to do this independently of the HTML that makes up each web page.</p>

    <h3>Types of css </h3>
    <p>There are three types of CSS which are given below.</p>
    
    <center>
        <table border="2px">
            <tr><th>CSS property</th><th>Describes</th></tr>
            <tr><td>Inline css</td><td>Inline CSS contains the CSS property in the body section attached with the element known as inline CSS.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Internal or Embedded css</td><td>The CSS ruleset should be within the HTML file in the head section i.e the CSS is embedded within the HTML file. </td></tr>
            <tr><td>External css</td><td>External CSS contains a separate CSS file that contains only style property with the help of tag attributes</td></tr>

    <p>JavaScript (js) is a light-weight object-oriented programming language which is used by several websites for scripting the webpages. 
        It is an interpreted, full-fledged programming language that enables dynamic interactivity on websites when applied to an HTML document. 
        It was introduced in the year 1995 for adding programs to the webpages in the Netscape Navigator browser. Since then, it has been adopted 
        by all other graphical web browsers. With JavaScript, users can build modern web applications to interact directly without reloading the 
        page every time. The traditional website uses js to provide several forms of interactivity and simplicity</p>

    <h2>Features of JavaScript</h2>
    <p>There are following features of JavaScript:</p>
    <ol type="1">
        <li>All popular web browsers support JavaScript as they provide built-in execution environments.</li>
        <li>JavaScript follows the syntax and structure of the C programming language. Thus, it is a structured programming language</li>
        <li>JavaScript is a weakly typed language, where certain types are implicitly cast (depending on the operation).</li>
        <li>JavaScript is an object-oriented programming language that uses prototypes rather than using classes for inheritance.</li>
        <li>It is a light-weighted and interpreted language.</li>
        <li>It is a case-sensitive language.</li>
        <li>JavaScript is supportable in several operating systems including, Windows, macOS, etc.</li>
        <li>It provides good control to the users over the web browsers.</li>
    </ol>
